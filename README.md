## Typst Support

The app has some support for [Typst](https://typst.app/) inside `code` blocks. This has been added specially for math and formulas; other Typst features may not work correctly. (But you're free to try). You can add Typst using `typ` or `typst` as the languge attribut inside a `code` block.
